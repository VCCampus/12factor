# Prompt Engineering UI/UX Optimization Requirements

## Problem Analysis

Current Prompt Engineering functionality has three core issues:
1. **Navigation Conflict**: Creates visual and conceptual conflict with 12Factor theme
2. **Content Fragmentation**: Short courses forced into separate pages, breaking learning continuity
3. **Unfriendly URLs**: Numeric paths harm SEO and user experience

## Optimization Solutions

### 1. Navigation Restructure
**Current Issue**: Prompt Engineering menu competes with 12Factor theme for user attention

**Solution**:
- Consolidate Prompt Engineering into expandable secondary menu
- Use `>` symbol or other interactive design for hide/expand functionality
- Maintain consistency with website primary color `#98a971`
- Ensure dropdown menu is beautifully designed and fully functional

### 2. Learning Content Integration
**Current Issue**: Short course content split across independent pages, fragmenting learning experience

**Analysis Tasks**:
- Review existing `.ipynb` file content completeness
- Evaluate actual length and depth of each course
- Determine if short courses need to be merged into single pages

**Integration Principles**:
- Merge courses with insufficient content length for display
- Maintain logical coherence of learning paths
- Optimize page loading and navigation efficiency

### 3. URL Structure Optimization
**Current Issue**: Numeric paths (e.g., `/course/1`) are unfriendly to users and search engines

**Improvement Goals**:
- Use semantic URL slugs (e.g., `/prompt-engineering/basic-techniques`)
- Enhance SEO performance
- Improve user experience and content discoverability
- Keep URLs concise yet descriptive

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Navigation menu restructure (affects overall user experience)
2. **Medium Priority**: Content integration (requires analysis of existing content first)
3. **Low Priority**: URL structure (needs backward compatibility consideration)

## Technical Considerations

- Ensure all changes are compatible with existing i18n system
- Maintain responsive design performance across all devices
- Consider impact on existing user bookmarks and external links
- Follow existing TypeScript and ESLint standards

## Source Analysis

### Original Material Structure
- **Source**: `rdd/anthropic-prompt-engineering`
- **Format**: 12 Jupyter notebooks covering fundamental to advanced prompt engineering
- **Content**: Interactive exercises with Python/Anthropic API integration
- **Structure**: Sequential learning path with hands-on coding exercises

### Current 12Factor.me Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **I18n**: next-intl with English/Chinese support
- **State**: Zustand for lightweight state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark mode
- **Data Pattern**: Stage/Principle hierarchical structure
- **Components**: Reusable FlashCard, Quiz, Navigation components
